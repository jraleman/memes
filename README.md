My personal collection of memes saved through the years

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  ### Start development server

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/jraleman/memes
    cd memes/
    yarn start
    ```

2.  ### Open the source code and start editing!

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `memes/` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`.
    Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
